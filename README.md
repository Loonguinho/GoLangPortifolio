# GoLang Repository
This repository is for my Go projects and study cases.
-- FOR THE FUTURE --
1. Build an API - using FastAPI or a similar framework.
2. Connect a database - use PostgreSQL or MySQL. 
3. Add authentication - learn JWT or OAuth to secure user access.
4. Boost performance - implement caching with Redis and write efficient queries.
5. Scale up - deploy your app, then monitor and improve.
